Kanvica was interactive text chat communication software, with some additional convenience features like:
 - file transfer
 - ringing our peer
 - sending message on repeat
 - Pong-like game
  
Communication is performed via the MIDI interfaces to interconnect SAM Coupe and ATARI ST.

- kanvica-z80-v4.transf57.Z - is the latest version for SAM I was able to rescue from floppy images I still have
- kanvica-z80-v4.transf.bin - is the compiled SAM version (not sure if v57, or other though)

For full functionality counterpart code is required for the Atari.
