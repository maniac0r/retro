Kanvica was interactive text chat communication software, with some additional features like file transfer, or ringing our peer.
Communication is performed via the MIDI interfaces to interconnect SAM Coupe and ATARI ST.

kanvica-z80-v4.transf57.Z is the latest version I was able to rescue from floppy images I still have
kanvica-z80-v4.transf.bin is the compiled version (not sure if v57, or other though)

For full functionality counterpart code is required for the Atari.
